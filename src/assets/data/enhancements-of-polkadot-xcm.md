## What is XCM?

<br />
<br />
### Definition
<br />

XCM (Cross-Chain Messaging) is a crucial component of the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling seamless communication and interoperability between parachains. It's the set of rules messages or the "common language" spoken between different channels.

<alert type="secondary">
‚ö†Ô∏è XCM is just a language, not a protocol that responsible for transporting messages.
</alert>

XCM's A-4 üòé: 4 high-level core design principles which it stands to follow

- **Asynchronous**: The sender sends the message without waiting for it to be processed.
- **Absolute**: Guarantees that the message will be delivered and understood correctly.
- **Asymmetric**: There is no direct confirmation that the message has been received.
- **Agnostic**: Works without knowing or depending on the system it is sending to.

<br />
<br />
### XCM Transport Methods
<br />

There are three primary methods for message passing, one of which is under development:

1. XCMP (Cross-Consensus Message Passing)
2. Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing (HRMP/XCMP-lite)
3. VMP (Vertical Message Passing)

#### XCMP (Cross-Chain Messaging Passing)

<alert type="warning">
‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION

XCMP is currently under development, and most of the cross-chain messages pass through HRMP channels for the time being.

</alert>
**[XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm-transport#xcmp-design)** allows secure communication between parachains. It comes in two forms: Direct and Relayed:

- **Direct**: Message data is sent directly between parachains, making it highly scalable and O(1) on the Relay-chain side.
- **Relayed**: Message data is routed through the Relay-chain and piggybacks on VMP, resulting in lower scalability. On-demand parachains may experience message delays due to queue growth.

#### VMP (Vertical Messaging Passing)

Vertical Messaging Passing is the communication between the Relay Chain and parachains. It can be divided into two formats:

- UMP (Upward Message Passing): Message from the **parachain** to the **Relay Chain**.
- DMP (Downward Message Passing): Message from the **Relay Chain** to a **parachain**.

#### HRMP(Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing)

Different from VMP, which is communication between a specific parachain with the Relay-chain, HRMP is communication between parachains and require minimal involvement of the relay chain Relay-chain.

### XCM Virtual Machine

At the heart of XCM is something called the XCVM (Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine). This is like a special computer that only understands the language of XCM. It follows a set of rules (the XCVM specification) to make sure messages are translated correctly.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

- Messages: In XCM, messages are like little programs made up of instructions. These instructions tell the XCVM what to do, like transferring assets from one blockchain to another.

- Execution: The XCVM runs these instructions one by one. If everything goes smoothly, it completes the task. If there‚Äôs an error, it stops and lets you know something went wrong.

- Customization: The great thing about XCVM is that it‚Äôs designed to be customizable3. This means that developers can tweak it to fit the specific needs of their blockchain.

## Use-cases

With XCM, the possibilities for cross-chain functionality are expanded, enabling a range of innovative applications and services:

- Multi-Chain DApps: XCM enables dApps to interact with multiple blockchains for a seamless user experience.
- Token Interoperability: XCM allows tokens to be transferred and traded across different blockchains.
- Cross-Chain Governance: XCM facilitates decentralized governance across multiple blockchains.
- Cross-Chain Data Exchange: XCM enables the transfer of data between different blockchains for decentralized data marketplaces.
- Cross-Chain Identity Management: XCM supports the transfer of identity information between blockchains for decentralized identity systems.
- Interconnected Smart Contracts: XCM allows smart contracts on different blockchains to interact and execute complex cross-chain logic.
- Decentralized Finance (DeFi): XCM enhances DeFi applications by enabling asset and liquidity movement across blockchains.
- Supply Chain Management: XCM can streamline supply chain processes by enabling cross-chain tracking and verification.
- Gaming and NFTs: XCM allows for the transfer and interoperability of in-game assets and NFTs across different gaming platforms and blockchains.
- Cross-Chain Oracles: XCM enables oracles to provide data feeds to multiple blockchains, enhancing the reliability and reach of decentralized applications.
- And more!!

## XCM Upgrades

From December 2020 to 2022, XCM has been updated and improved multiple times to increase its flexibility, diversity, and efficiency. This shows that Polkadot remains a state-of-the-art technology, with the foundation consistently focused on technological development.

<br />
<br />
### XCM V3
<br />

The XCM V3 has improved the protocol that facilitates he splitting of applications across different sharded protocols, parachains, and more.

- Multichain Decomposition Tools
- Expectations and Branchings
- Asset and NFT Transfer
- Safe Dispatches

The goal of XCM V3 is to decompose the Polkadot Relay Chain into ‚Äúsystem chains functionally‚Äù ‚Äî with the primary functions of the Relay Chain to provide security and interoperability.

The key is to create a common good parachain for each function (governance, staking, auctions, assets). This is the competitive advantage of the Polkadot architecture over other ecosystems.

### XCM V4 Coming Soon
<br />

According to [Gavin Wood, at Polkadot Decoded 2022](https://youtu.be/K2c6xrCoQOU?t=1920), it is noted that XCM V4 is in development and addresses issues such as:

- Dynamic fee discovery
- Checkpoints
- Instant version negotiation
- Smart contracts
